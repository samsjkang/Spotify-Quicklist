## Spotify Quicklist

A web app made to streamline the playlist editing.

### Phase 1: Home Frontend (DONE)

### Phase 2: Set up OAuth (DONE)

### Phase 3: Client-Side Fetch API
- Fetch user playlists using access_token query (DONE)
- Fetch songs from each playlist (DONE)
- Dynamically fetch songs from Spotify as user types in search bar (DONE*)

*\*The dynamic search currently has a few bugs. Core functionality works but it sometimes fetches songs that do not contain the typed words (in which case, a dropdown list will not appear). To sure that the correct song is entered, user has to either click the right song from the dropdown list or enter the song title followed by " by {Artist Name}".*
